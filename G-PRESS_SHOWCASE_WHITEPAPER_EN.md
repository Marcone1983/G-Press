## 1. The Problem: How PR Worked Before G-Press

### 1.1 The Old Way: External DPR Agencies

Before G-Press, GROWVERSE would have had to rely on press release distribution (DPR) agencies to reach journalists. Here's how this service typically works:

| Aspect | Traditional DPR Agency | Problem for GROWVERSE |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Cost** | €200-900/month fixed | Significant budget without guaranteed results |
| **Transparency** | Zero - you don't know if emails are sent | Impossible to measure ROI |
| **Tracking** | None - you don't know who opens or reads | No feedback for improvement |
| **Personalization** | Same text to everyone | Low engagement, ignored emails |
| **Database** | Theirs, not yours | Total dependency on the agency |
| **Learning** | Zero - each campaign starts from scratch | Chronic inefficiency |
| **Control** | Minimal - you only decide the text | No data-driven strategy |

### 1.2 Concrete Scenario: How Much We Would Have Spent

Consider the scenario of GROWVERSE wanting to send press releases regularly to promote its projects, announcements, and news:

**Basic Agency Option (€200/month):**
- Sending 1,300 emails per day (39,000/month)
- No open tracking
- No personalization
- Generic, unverified database
- **Annual cost: €2,400**
- **5-year cost: €12,000**

**Premium Agency Option (€900/month):**
- More curated service
- Some generic reports
- Still no real tracking
- **Annual cost: €10,800**
- **5-year cost: €54,000**

And the biggest problem? **You would never know if it actually works.** You pay, they send (maybe), but you have no idea if journalists open the emails, read them, or trash them directly.

### 1.3 The Manual Work Alternative

The alternative to an agency would be doing everything manually:

| Activity | Estimated Time | Frequency | Hours/Month |
|----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Journalist research | 2 hours | Weekly | 8 hours |
| Email verification | 1 hour | Weekly | 4 hours |
| Press release writing | 3 hours | Weekly | 12 hours |
| Email personalization | 4 hours | Weekly | 16 hours |
| Manual sending | 2 hours | Weekly | 8 hours |
| Follow-up | 2 hours | Weekly | 8 hours |
| **TOTAL** | | | **56 hours/month** |

At an hourly cost of €30 (conservative for a PR specialist), that would be **€1,680/month** or **€20,160/year** of work.

## 2. The Solution: What We Built

### 2.1 G-Press in Brief

G-Press is a proprietary mobile application that completely automates the press release distribution process using advanced artificial intelligence. It was developed internally and belongs 100% to GROWVERSE.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React Native / Expo (cross-platform iOS/Android mobile app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with tRPC (type-safe APIs)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (serverless SQLite, cloud persistence)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 (multi-agent system)
- **Email**: Resend API (enterprise-grade deliverability)
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Workers (global edge computing)

### 2.2 The Multi-Agent AI System

The heart of G-Press is an artificial intelligence system composed of three specialized agents working in sequence:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│     RESEARCHER      │
│                     │
│ • Analyzes trends   │
│ • Finds news angles │
│ • Profiles targets  │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   SENIOR WRITER     │
│                     │
│ • Writes article    │
│ • Uses NLP techn.   │
│ • Personalizes tone │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   EDITOR IN CHIEF   │
│                     │
│ • Reviews text      │
│ • Fact-checking     │
│ • Optimizes quality │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Researcher Agent**: Analyzes information sources, identifies trends relevant to GROWVERSE, and selects the most suitable journalists based on their area of expertise and engagement history.

**Senior Writer Agent**: Generates professional-quality articles and press releases, using persuasive copywriting techniques and adapting the tone to the specific target.

**Editor in Chief Agent**: Reviews each piece of content, verifies facts against the company Knowledge Base, and optimizes the text to maximize publication probability.
